# remote-work-burnout-analysis-and-prediction
A machine learning project that analyzes factors associated with remote work and predicts employee burnout levels using data-driven methods.

## Overview

With the rapid adoption of remote work, employee burnout has become a critical concern for organizations and individuals. This project explores the relationship between work-from-home conditions and burnout by performing data analysis, feature exploration, and predictive modeling.

The goal is to identify key burnout drivers and build a machine learning model capable of predicting burnout risk.

## Objectives

- Analyze remote work conditions and their impact on burnout
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identify key contributing factors
- Build a predictive machine learning model
- Evaluate model performance

## Dataset

The dataset contains features related to remote work conditions, productivity factors, and employee well-being indicators used to predict burnout levels.

Typical features include:

- Work hours and workload
- Work-life balance indicators
- Productivity metrics
- Remote work environment factors
- Burnout level (target variable)
